My professional blog for my project five of my study on openclassroom

Context:

The project is to create my own professional blog. This web site is broken down into two large groups of pages:

  .Useful pages for all visitors.
  .The pages that allow you to administer your blog.
  
Here is the list of pages that will have to be accessible from your website:
  
  .The home page.
  .The page listing all of the blogs posts.
  .The page displaying a blog post.
  .The page for adding a blog post.
  .The page for editing a blog post.
  .The pages that allow you to edit/delete a blog post.
  .Login/user Registration pages.
  
We will develop an administration part that will have to be accessible only to registered and validated users.
The administration pages will therefore be accessible on conditions and ensure the security of the administration part.

The following information must be presented on the home page:
Important: You will ensure that there are no security vulnerabilities (XSS, CRSF, SQL injection, session hijacking,...).
