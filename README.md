My professional blog for my project five of my study on openclassroom

## Context:

The project is to create my own professional blog. This web site is broken down into two large groups of pages:

  .Useful pages for all visitors.
  .The pages that allow you to administer your blog.
  
Here is the list of pages that will have to be accessible from your website:
  
  .The home page.
  .The page listing all of the blogs posts.
  .The page displaying a blog post.
  .The page for adding a blog post.
  .The page for editing a blog post.
  .The pages that allow you to edit/delete a blog post.
  .Login/user Registration pages.
  
We will develop an administration part that will have to be accessible only to registered and validated users.
The administration pages will therefore be accessible on conditions and ensure the security of the administration part.

The following information must be presented on the home page:

  .Your first and last name.
  .A photo and/or a logo.
  .A catch phrase that looks like you (example: "Martin Durand, the developer you need!").
  .A menu for navigating through all the pages of your website.
  .A contact form (at the submission of this form, an email with all this information will be sent to you) with the following fields:       .Surname/First Name
    .Contact email
    .Message
  .A link to your CV in PDF format.
  .And all the links to social networks where we can follow you (Github, LinkedIn, Twitter...).

On the page listing all blogs posts (from the newest to the oldest), you have to display the following information for each blog post:

  .The title.
  .The date of last modification.
  .The Châpo.
  .and a link to the blog post.
  
On the page detailing a blog post, you have to display the following information:

  .le titre.
  .le chapô.
  .le contenu.
  .l’auteur.
  .la date de dernière mise à jour.
  .le formulaire permettant d’ajouter un commentaire (soumis pour validation).
  .les listes des commentaires validés et publiés.
  
On the page for editing a blog post, the user has the option to edit the title, Chapo, author and content fields.
In the footer menu, it must include a link to access the administration of the blog.
Important: You will ensure that there are no security vulnerabilities (XSS, CRSF, SQL injection, session hijacking,...).
